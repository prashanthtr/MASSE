The system implementation that was used to experimentally study the issues of
human-agent partnership in musical co-improvisation is provided in the
repository.

The following files are provided in this repository:

1) Training.js - A background input for humans to play solo play rhythmic solos.

2) Training_wsystem.js - an agent that repeatedly produces bass hits on the beat.

3) Training_wsystem_offbeat.js - an agent that repeatedly produces bass hits on off-beats.

4) Agent_poisson - The control agent that listens and copies the density of the
played by the musicians

5) Performances from the experiments to evaluate musicians' sense of co-creation
with the agent.

The remaining agent implementations will be provided on request.
